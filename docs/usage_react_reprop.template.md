## `react-reprop`

Reprop's React integration `react-reprop` is work in progress.

Check out https://github.com/brillout/reprop/issues/1 to see its progress.

You can use `reprop`, Reprop's standalone version, in the meantime.

The API will be something like the following;

~~~js
!INLINE ../examples/todo/react-reprop/components/TodoList.js
~~~

~~~js
!INLINE ../examples/todo/react-reprop/components/TodoItem.js
~~~

~~~js
!INLINE ../examples/todo/react-reprop/app.js
~~~
